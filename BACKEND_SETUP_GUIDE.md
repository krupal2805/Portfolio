# 🚀 Backend Setup Guide for Contact Form

Your portfolio now has a fully functional backend for the contact form! Here's how to complete the setup:

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Backend server created with Express.js
- ✅ Email integration with Nodemailer
- ✅ Form validation and security features
- ✅ Frontend integration updated
- ✅ Environment file created

## 🔧 Complete Setup Steps

### 1. Configure Gmail App Password

**Important**: You need a Gmail App Password, not your regular password!

1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Enable **2-Factor Authentication** (if not already enabled)
3. Go to **Security** → **App passwords**
4. Select **Mail** as the app and **Other** as device
5. Generate the app password (16 characters)
6. Copy this password

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Edit the file: `portfolio-app/backend/.env`

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=krupalsiddhapura@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password-here
```

**Replace** `your-16-character-app-password-here` with the Gmail App Password you generated.

### 3. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd portfolio-app/backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 5000
📧 Contact endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/contact
🏥 Health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### 4. Test the Backend

Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Server is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 5. Start the Frontend

In a new terminal:
```bash
cd portfolio-app
npm start
```

### 6. Test the Complete Contact Form

1. Go to your portfolio website
2. Navigate to the Contact section
